## Description
The concept behind this project for CSS to the rescue was an computer with a Pear OS. Which has been infected with a 'virus' and all the windows/programs act weird.

There where a few requirements for this project. We had to choose an asignment, a context, 2 restrictions and last but not least work with a so cald selector First CSS Methodology.

## context
* dark-mode

### restrictions
* When SVG meets CSS: Shapes / Masks / SVG
* Design must be visually appealing and it must meet Level AAA conformance of the WCAG.

## Learned (reflection)
After more than 6 months of barely touching code, there were certainly things I've had forgotten about or didn't even know about. I might have heard about it, but never actually tried it myself. Looking back at this project, I realized that Level AAA isn't made for illustrations and is quite difficult. Nonetheless is was fun trying it out, but bit frustrating as well.

* SVG
* animations
* dark/light theme
* selectors 
  * +, ~, <
  * :target
* checkboxes
* mix-blend-mode (so fun, definitly going to try more stuff)
* filter

Overall I feel like I'm back to the code game again, almost..
